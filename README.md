### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Igor

I'm a Computer Scientist with experience in Fullstack software development and Agentic AI systems. I am originally from [Loanda](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanda) and currently based on [MaringÃ¡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maring%C3%A1). I graduated from [UNIOESTE](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidade_Estadual_do_Oeste_do_Paran%C3%A1) on August 2022 with 3.5 GPA and 88/100 average grade. 

I mainly focus on backend and LLM centric cevelopment using technologies such as Python, FastAPI, SQL, Langchain, Langfuse, Qdrant, and so on. I also am able work a little with Frontend, but is not my focus, I have past experiences with JavaScript, Typescript, with Node and Next. I contributed to complex projects like Third-party risk assessments AI system, banking applications, fault tolerance systems for oil rigs and real-time stock monitoring applications. I also took part in a lot of research projects during my BSc, having [papers published](http://lattes.cnpq.br/4911200081874612) on international scale symposiums and being part of the [PETComp Group](instagram.com/petcomp_unioeste) during all my graduation. 

Working with exciting technologies and dynamic teams is what makes me feel accomplished professionally, and that's what I look for.

My personal interests are very broad, they go from Veganism, Tabletop Role Playing Games and Hiking to Bodybuilding, Modified Cars and Competitive First Person Shooters.
