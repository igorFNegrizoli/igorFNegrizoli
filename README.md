### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Igor

I'm a Computer Scientist from [Loanda](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanda) currently based on [Cascavel](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascavel_(Paran%C3%A1)). I graduated from [UNIOESTE](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidade_Estadual_do_Oeste_do_Paran%C3%A1) on August 2022.

After taking part on research projects during my BSc, having [papers published](http://lattes.cnpq.br/4911200081874612) on international scale symposiums and being part of the [PETComp Group](https://petsite-bd39a.web.app/), I've decided to pursue carreer as a Software Developer. Actually I'm looking for my first job as a Junior Software Developer.

My personal interests are very broad, they go from Vegetarianism, Cheerleading and Tabletop Role Playing Games from Bodybuilding, Modified Cars and Competitive First Person Shooters.

You can reach me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igorfnegrizoli/) or email at igor.negrizoli@gmail.com
